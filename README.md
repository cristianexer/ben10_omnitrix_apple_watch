## Omnitrix App for Apple Watch (tested on Apple Watch 3)

The apple plays some sounds effects from Ben 10

You can use the crown to pick up an alien and tap to see the unmasked alien

### It works independent of the iPhone, but you need a paired device to build the project

### You can alos find the python scritps for image crawling and image formating (the messy version)

# This project was just for fun, I do not have any copyright or license for the (aliens and sound effects)images and the sound. 

However you can use the diamond shape and the main omnitrix.


## You can use everything you want from this project
